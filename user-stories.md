#H2 Focus group members

*Angela is from Wisconsin and has never ridden public transportation. She needs to be able to use the app despite having motion sickness so the interface must be very simple.

*Theodore is from New York City and rides the subway (with multiple advertisements) every day. He needs the app to grab his attention or he will be distracted.

*Jeremy is from California and does not believe in purchasing things online. He needs the app to prove to him that choosing and purchasing items would be simple.


#H2 Marketing Team members

*Eric is the marketing team manager and he is concerned that his products are too quirky. He needs to see quickly which items are generating very little interest so he can kill certain items that are not performing well.

*Nicolas is the social media manager and needs to follow trends quickly and easily. He needs an hour-by-hour chart of which products were clicked and by which demographic groups, by age, so he can adjust his social media strategy accordingly.

*Annika is the new product manager and is very excited about all of the products. She needs data that will prove to her team that they are headed down the right path in terms of product selection.
